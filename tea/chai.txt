Have you ever had black tea? Was the black tea you had boring and plain? Don't worry because Yonas thought the same. But unlike Yonas, Aisha has had a variety of black teas, including Masala Chai! Chai differs slightly,it's an aromatic beverage that blends black tea with various herbs and spices. In particular we'd like to recommend adding cardamom, cloves, and peppercorn (Black pepper).
