Matcha is a finely ground powder made from specially grown green tea leaves. Unlike regular green tea, where the leaves are made from the entire leaf. Matcha is made by only taking the purest parts of the plant leaves, and finely grounding them after. Green tea is steeped in water and then discarded, matcha involves consuming the entire leaf, providing a more concentrated source of nutrients. Matcha is well known for its 'grassy' flavor, but is so much more than that. Its is higher in concentration of antioxidants, vitamins, and caffeine than the other teas on this list.
