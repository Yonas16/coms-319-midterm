Do you still want flavor retention and sweetness? Try the <b> Medium Roast!</b> 

Medium Roast is a brown color and rarely has an oily surface. Coffees like this have a medium acidity and a rounded flavor profile. Roasting to this level allows us to maintain many of the unique flavors of the coffee's origin, but it also begins to reach into the deep caramel sweetness of this roast.
